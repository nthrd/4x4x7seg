# 4x4x7Segment Display #
########################

This is a small board with a lot of digits. Featuring four [HP  4-digit 7-segment  bubble displays][1] on a board designed to be mated with the [Adafruit HT16K33 breakout][2], this will quickly allow you to display four values using i^(2)c.

Mounting:

* Solder a right angle header strip to the bottom header for vertical mounting.
* Solder straight header strips to the bottom or both headers for horizontal mounting.
* The top header is not electrically connected and is for more stable horizontal mounting.
